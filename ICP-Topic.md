# **Objectif** : 
**Research Project (2025)**  
Dear Students,  
As we move forward in our course, I wanted to let you know that a research project will be assigned to each student. The aim of this project is to help you gain a deeper understanding of the course material and to develop your critical thinking and research skills.   For this project, you will be provided with research papers that you are required to read and summarize. Additionally, you are expected to search for the latest innovations in the domain and identify any potential challenges and gaps. You will then prepare a presentation of no more than 12 minutes, which will be presented in class, and the content will be discussed.  The presentations will be scheduled on April 22th 2025, and it is important to note that this research project will replace the mid-term exam (DS). So, please plan accordingly and ensure that you are fully prepared to present your work on this date.  
Please note that you are required to choose one paper for your research project, and add your names in the comments section below the announcement. Please be advised that the selection will be based on a first-come, first-served basis, so I encourage you to make your selection as soon as possible to secure your preferred paper. I encourage you to take this project seriously and to use this opportunity to develop your skills in research, critical thinking, and presentation.
