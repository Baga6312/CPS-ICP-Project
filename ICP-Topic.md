# **Objectif** : 
**Research Project (2025)**  
Dear Students,  
As we move forward in our course, I wanted to let you know that a research project will be assigned to each student. The aim of this project is to help you gain a deeper understanding of the course material and to develop your critical thinking and research skills.   For this project, you will be provided with research papers that you are required to read and summarize. Additionally, you are expected to search for the latest innovations in the domain and identify any potential challenges and gaps. You will then prepare a presentation of no more than 12 minutes, which will be presented in class, and the content will be discussed.  The presentations will be scheduled on April 22th 2025, and it is important to note that this research project will replace the mid-term exam (DS). So, please plan accordingly and ensure that you are fully prepared to present your work on this date.  
Please note that you are required to choose one paper for your research project, and add your names in the comments section below the announcement. Please be advised that the selection will be based on a first-come, first-served basis, so I encourage you to make your selection as soon as possible to secure your preferred paper. I encourage you to take this project seriously and to use this opportunity to develop your skills in research, critical thinking, and presentation.

# Introduction : 
The study explores rising cybersecurity threats in vehicles, focusing on the Controller Area Network (CAN). CAN's original focus on speed and reliability omitted security, creating vulnerabilities. The proposed intrusion detection system, featuring a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and decision engine, identifies anomalies in real-time. Real-world testing confirms the system secures CAN networks efficiently, emphasizing the need for better security in connected vehicles.

1. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Exploits
"Cybersecurity in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Systems: A Systematic Review"
 This paper provides a comprehensive review of V2G cybersecurity, highlighting vulnerabilities such as insecure communication channels, denial-of-service (DoS), spoofing, data manipulation, and botnet attacks targeting EVs, charging stations, and the grid1.
**Reference**: arXiv:2503.15730v1 (2025)
"Local Power Grids at Risk – An Experimental and Simulation-based Analysis of Attacks on Vehicle-To-Grid Communication"
 This study experimentally analyzes attacks on V2G communication, including manipulation of grid stability and malicious control of EV charging/discharging4.
2. OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) Vulnerabilities
The systematic review on V2G cybersecurity also covers vulnerabilities in protocols used for EV charging, such as OCPP, noting issues with weak authentication, insecure communication, and susceptibility to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks1.
**Reference**: arXiv:2503.15730v1 (2025)
3. Malware Injection via Charging Stations
The same systematic review discusses malware and malicious injection threats to both EVs and charging stations, emphasizing the risk of malware spreading through insecure or compromised charging infrastructure1.
**Reference**: arXiv:2503.15730v1 (2025)
4. Key Fob/Phone-as-a-Key Attacks
The review identifies insecure authentication mechanisms, including weak key management and vulnerabilities in wireless communication (such as key fobs and phone-as-a-key systems), as attack vectors for unauthorized access to EVs and charging systems1.
**Reference**: arXiv:2503.15730v1 (2025)
For a focused review of each attack type, see:
arXiv:2503.15730v1 – "Cybersecurity in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Systems: A Systematic Review"1
ACM Digital Library – "Local Power Grids at Risk – An Experimental and Simulation-based Analysis of Attacks on Vehicle-To-Grid Communication"4
These papers offer detailed discussions of the cybersecurity landscape and specific vulnerabilities for electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure.
